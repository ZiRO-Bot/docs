# Introduction

:::warning

This page is meant for developers who want to contribute and/or hosts the bot.

Free hosting like Heroku is not supported! Please use a proper Cloud Server/VPS
instead. If you insist, you can try Railway instead of Heroku to host the bot
as it uses Docker (You can find the bot's Dockerfile
[here](https://github.com/ZiRO-Bot/Z3R0/blob/overhaul/docker/Dockerfile)), but
issue related to Railway will still gonna be ignored!

:::

## Prerequisite
- Python 3.10+
- SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Knowledge on working with Discord Bot and Python (a bit of Docker knowledge
  is recommended)
